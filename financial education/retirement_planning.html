    <h3>401k vs IRA vs roth vs pretax</h3>
    <p>
        different accounts and what the do for you.
    </p>
    <h4>401k and associated accounts</h4>
    <p>
        the 401 retirement plan/account is employer based, meaning that you contribute to one when you earn a paycheck as an employee. this deffers from being a contract employee. your employer will match your contributions or just give you a set amount to a retirement account. when an employer matches your contribution, they will match you a percentage up to an fixed amount. such as 50% up to 6%. this means if you contribute 6% of your pay to the 401k they will add on top of ALL other pay another 3%. this means that per check you will be putting away a total of 9% per check. if you contribute 4% then your employer will contribute 2% for a total of 6%. some employers will will match dollar for dollar to a set amount, like 3 and 3 up to 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        if you do not take advantage of the contribution matching at a job you are simply leaving money on the table. when you leave an employer you may not be contributing to it anymore but that does not mean you do not have let it be or forfit it. you have options. you can usually keep it with the broker that is with that company and still manage it. however when you start a new retirement account with a new employer you can roll it over into the new account. this is normal and a smart move.
    </p>
    <h4>types of contributions</h4>
    <h5>pre-tax</h5>
    <p>
        pre-tax contributions are exacly that taken pre-tax and put in the account so that you can let it grow and tax it when you pull it out in retirement. hopefully you are in a smaller tax bracket when you are retired.
    </p>
    <h5>Roth</h5>
    <p>
        roth contributions are post tax. that means you pay the taxes up front and after retirement you can withdraw with out tax. pretty simple but it is a good idea to combine your contribution types to minimize risk and allow you options in taxes when withdrawing.
    </p>
    <h5>rollover</h5>
    <p>rollover funds may be subject to restrictions and or other stuff MORE INFO NEEDED</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>rollovers and you</h3>
    <p>
        a rollover is when you take an account you left with a previouse employer or in an IRA and you want to consolidate it ino a single account.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>judging the options you have</h3>
    <p>
        when you participate in a retirement plan you will be narrowed down to certain investment options by the people managing the plan and the contract involved. usually you are restricted to mutual funds and they are pretty safe and narrow in scope. the managers intention is to provide a near full proof investment option set. 
    </p>
    <p>
        usually retirement plans will include...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>an index 500 fund</li>
        <li>some large cap mutual funds</li>
        <li>mid cap funds</li>
        <li>small cap funds</li>
        <li>target date funds</li>
        <li>usually a cash stable fund</li>
        <li>maybe a few special options</li>
        <li>international fund</li>
        <li>total market fund</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    some retirement plans will allow you to use an external brokerage after you have accumulated a certain amount with mutual fund only restrictions. but that opens you up to the entire mutual fund market. 
</p>
<p>
    you should become familiar with your plans features and restrictions.

    <h3>using the accounts you have to do very basic trading</h3>
    <p>
        the accounts i have experience with allow you to move principal or all investment funds from a fund and re alocate it. I have used this to pull money from investments into stable cash when i thought the market was unstable or headed for a crash/dip. you must be careful because some funds will give you time restrictions on moving money in and out of funds.
