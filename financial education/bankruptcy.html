        different types of bankruptcy
    </p>
    <p>
        There are six types of bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Code, located at Title 11 of the United States Code:

        Chapter 7: basic liquidation for individuals and businesses; also known as straight bankruptcy; it is the simplest and quickest form of bankruptcy available
        Chapter 9: municipal bankruptcy; a federal mechanism for the resolution of municipal debts
        Chapter 11: rehabilitation or reorganization, used primarily by business debtors but sometimes by individuals with substantial debts and assets; known as corporate bankruptcy, it is a form of corporate financial reorganization that typically allows companies to continue to function while they follow debt repayment plans
        Chapter 12: rehabilitation for family farmers and fishermen;
        Chapter 13: rehabilitation with a payment plan for individuals with a regular source of income; enables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their debts; also known as Wage Earner Bankruptcy
        Chapter 15: ancillary and other international cases; provides a mechanism for dealing with bankruptcy debtors and helps foreign debtors clear debts
